## Project Description

`vibe-coding` is a sandbox repository for building and validating quick proof-of-concept (POC) ideas.  
Each POC is isolated under `pocs/` so experiments can move fast without affecting other work.

The project focuses on:

- Rapid experimentation and iteration
- Capturing technical learnings in `docs/deepwiki`
- Reusing common helpers from `pocs/shared`
- Keeping setup simple for local development in VS Code/dev containers

### Repository Structure (high level)

- `pocs/` — individual POC implementations
- `docs/deepwiki/` — project wiki and architecture/decision notes
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for scaffolding, linting, and testing
